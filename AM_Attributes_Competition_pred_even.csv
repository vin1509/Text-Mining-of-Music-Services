1,"Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I'm not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I'm wary about, but I took the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I've listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.). If you're listening on a web browser, it's constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music (when clicking on other music that might interest you) could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast (to my knowledge). Now that I've purchased the year subscription, I'll certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back."
0,"I loved this at first. I was excites thinking FINALLY something better than Pandora! But day one songs stopped half way through to load like there was a connection issue each time I left home. I was using 4G so I don't get that. since then, it's happening more and more frequently. Whether I'm home or not, on Wi-Fi or 4G. Still keeps stopping mid-song to either load or the app just crashes altogether. It has potential but I'm disappointed I had to go back to Pandora."
0,"When I use with Bluetooth in car  the displayed data is missing artist.  I can see track and album but artist data missing.  This only happens with Amazon music.  Google, songza, milk, Pandora, Spotify all display complete data"
0,"I'm pleased with Amazon Prime Music on my desktop and Android devices, but I'm not pleased with the Amazon Cloud Player on my Samsung Smart TV. The Cloud Player has limited functionality and will not play Amazon Prime music (it will only play my music).Unfortunately 90% of my use of Amazon Prime Music would be via my Samsung Smart TV. Therefore I'm back to Pandora and other apps on the TV."
1,"This app gives you access to all of the music that Amazon has. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get accessed to free music that you can even download top you're devices. There are stations recommended for you & playlists you can create by adding music to your library. It's definitely my new go-to for music. It's like combining Pandora & an MP3 player. Best of birth worlds!"
0,"page does not open, see dog pic,s - not as easy as the first version a couple of years ago - makes want to go back to pandora or google tunes -"
0,"The absolute worst streaming music app I have ever used.  It constantly stops streaming regardless of the device I am using to listen to music.  This happens on any network when I attempt to use the device.  It even stops on my Kindle.  You would think it if was going to work, the best option would be on the Kindle but nope.  I have no problems with Spotify or Pandora ever stopping.  If I wasn't a Prime member, there is no way I would ever use this completely useless services."
0,"I listen to music, as I take my daily walk.  I chose this product, because the FM radio app was non-functional, and at times Pandora is unreliable.  The Amazon MP3 app is amazing.  It's always there!  I like that I can create customized playlists--never had one before.  The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick.  I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me.  I'm not too savvy with apps anyway, but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon, for making this free app available to your customers."
1,"I love this! I listened to Pandora for a long long time. Then I found out that this was a benefit of having an Amazon Prime account. So I went through and added a whole bunch of songs. I found it easiest to look up a song, then go to a playlist it was in, and then add songs like a crazy person from there LOL I now have a very large library and often open up Amazon music and hit Shuffle and go about doing my chores, or cleaning up around the house. Certainly makes it more enjoyable! And it's nice to have ALL songs that I like. And with most of them, I've been able to add to my playlist for free. You can even download for offline play. Not every song is on here but I have only found one that I really wanted that wasn't. And I purchased it for 99 cents. I love this app/ bonus feature of Amazon Prime"
1,Amazon music is easy to use and I can find anything I want to listen to on it. I'm so much happier since I started my service. Since starting it I've dropped my Sirius account and Pandora. Strictly Amazon music for this girl from now on!
1,"As a Prime member, this app is pretty much an essential on my phone and Kindle Fire. I love creating playlists and have found a lot of great music to listen to for free. I would recommend this over Pandora (my previous favorite) any day! I wish that it would recommend music as I love to discover new artists but so far I've made it work by cross referencing a certain song with what others have added in playlists containing it."
0,"Beats Pandora! You can go back and listen to a song again, skip unlimited, no commercials/advertisements, and it doesn't stop playing with ""are you still listening?"""
0,"I have yet to figure out what is free and what isn't.  Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60+ songs bought?  Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply.  I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges.  I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
1,I think it's great! Better than Pandora.
1,"Don't care about the nay sayers. Prime is great, so oo many songs, playlists and genres of music to choose from. I also use Pandora. I pnow prefer Prime over pandora because I can play my music offline. There are a lot of music apps out there. They all have things you will love or hate. Give them a try, especially the ones with free trials. Simply pick the one that works best for you."
1,"This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would've given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
1,"I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it's not unlimited. For the annual fee, I expected to be able to stream any music I wanted. There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora, Milk, etc., but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music."
0,"After downloading the mobile app, and signing in to my Prime account, I attempted to stream music to my phone (Android).  I was disappointed.  It allowed me to download and play one album for free.  However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.Admittedly, I didn't mess with it for long, since the moment called for music (streaming to a Bluetooth speaker) and I didn't want to take the time.  So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly.  I'm sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.If I wasn't doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly (at least for this Prime member)."
1,This is all I listen to anymore! So done with Pandora!
0,"I'm a loyal Amazon customer, and have been for years. I was really excited when I learned that my Prime subscription included the music service. I was even more excited to use the new Amazon Prime Stations feature. I thought it would be great to no longer use Pandora's ad-laden app. Well, beyond the intrusive nature that Amazon apps have evolved into (seriously, Bezos, what's up with the lack of privacy?) that some others have commented on, the music app needs some help in its basic functionality. It's cumbersome to navigate the search feature (you have to be in just the right sub-area of the app to find what you're looking for). The stations would be great if there were a way at all to search or organize them. As it is now, there are so many stations (100's) and as far as I'm able to tell, they are not really organized in any way, rendering them much less useful. I'm not sure why there isn't a way to search the stations or at least save your favorite ones.Come on, Amazon! Step up your game with your app design!"
0,With the updates I can no longer access anything through any of the Amazon apps. It will not bring up the sign in page just sits there on a blank white screen. Iv let it sit there 20 mins and nothing I travel a lot for work and I enjoyed listening to the music I have but now I guess I can't listen to nothing but iHeartRadio
0,I love Amazon music. I can access so many albums and soundtracks without feeling obligated to buy anything. I don't use the radio function much but it works fine. This essentially feels like spotify without having to pay for a separate service as I already pay for amazon prime to begin with.
1,"FINALLY a music app that let's YOU decide what songs you listen to!  Genious! I am cancelling my pandora subscription immediately.  I wish I had known about this app  sooner. Awesome job, AZ! ANDa nice plus that the lyrics are displayed on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!"
0,I previously used Spotify almost exclusivly.  When Amazon released this app I tried it out and was very suprised at the amount of music available.  The stations are pretty good and you can easily download music to your devices.
1,"For a little more than the monthly cost of Pandora One you get to pick your songs & artists with unlimited skips, Amazon Videoand 2-day shipping on Prime purchases!"
1,"Songs regularly stop to buffer for no apparent reason.  No issues with other streaming sites or with Prime videos/movies.  Songs sound scratchy and just plain crappy.  Playlist options are great, love the music.  Same issue on laptop and mobile.  Sigh.. waiting for it to improve to leave IheartRadio."
1,"I love all the FREE songs I've listened to. I need a way to separate my son's songs from mine on the cloud though! Since I let him use it, I now scroll through HUNDREDS of songs that aren't mine.I also wish I could figure out how NOT to accidentally download 2 albums by same group, found out one is ""clean"" other isn't. Had to vet out the ones I doubled.But, it's still well worth it. So, I'm not sure why my son keeps pressing for spotify?"
1,I downloaded this Android app onto my BlackBerry Z30 from the Amazon App Store. The app did run but it was very sluggish. I ended up uninstalling it for this reason and also because the song selection available for Prime Streaming was not huge. I do like the idea of this though as I am currently a Spotify customer and would love to see the song selection expanded. I will keep an eye on this service to see if it gets better.
0,I only gave it 3 stars because I was hoping my grandson would be able to replace his spotify account with it and save me $10 a month.  He tried it and said it is like the prime movie choices. Limited to what is free and the rest you have to pay for.  I have to agree there so it really don't quite hit the mark.
1,Amazing!!! There is an assortment of music right at your fingertips. I can even go back and play my favorite songs again and again and again! I'm loving that! Good bye Pandora! I've found a new Music App to call Home!
0,I like the idea of saving songs to your playlist and downloading them for offline use. I feel though that there is less music than spotify and not nearly as friendly of a way the search the music.
0,"I've used Pandora, Iheart radio, and Google Play. I like Amazon Music primarily because i can download for off-line use from a very extensive library but like the seamless play when streaming also. The user interface is simple but powerful. Amazon Music is now the only music app that i use."
1,"It is a good alternative to Spotify and the like, and it's good that a wide selection of music comes included with a Amazon Prime subscription."
1,It's okay for the most part but it's still lacking songs I really like I would rather go with spotify
0,Music is old and does not keep up with iTunes or spotify
0,This needs to go back to the programmers ASAP. It crashes constantly locking up my Galaxy Note 2 to the point I have to a battery pull to reboot.It's NOT intuitive at all. Clunky to navigate.I'll try again in gew more builds. For now I'll keep paying for Spotify.
1,Not enough music. Very poor competition to others like spotify for example.
1,I am not a misic junkie.  I Dont have spotify or itunes and stuffI use Google's all accessits better for me. This service would be great if it offered the same volume of songs as Google.  I use Google to pick up current songs to play as I write fiction. My most inspirational songs are all free on Google.  Out of 86 Amazon had 10 free.  Not worth it honestly.
0,"Surprised I am liking this so much, for I am a Spotify girl.  I find it latches on to my taste better than some other music apps I have tried."
1,Playlist Generation unworkable full of glitches and bugs.No radio service comparable to spotify.No music suggestions for my Playlist or absent navigation for different music exposure.
1,Really great for most music. Definitely a step above Spotify but some songs require the unlimited version.
1,"I really like this, better than Pandora because you can choose music.  I don’t use spotify, but it seems like a similar service and it was free with my amazon prime!"
0,"Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster (Formerly Rhapsody) out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you've already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I've found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the ""Downloaded"" section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the ""Unlimited"" category. Anyway, I gave it a try for 1 week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra $2 per month is worth it."
1,"With prime I can download every song I want to listen to, no ads, not a limited number of skips every hour. Everything from old school to modern music. Wish this would have come out earlier. Iheartradio and definitely Pandora you're slacking."
1,Better than Spotify of course no ads.
1,"This service is not good.At the current rate, it will never compete with pandora, spotify, iheart, or any other music service. Not much of the music I want to hear, without buying it specifically through amazon. I'll pass."
1,Okay so I love this app. I love it. It's Spotify but I don't have to pay extra and on top of that it includes music already on my phone. BUT today it logged me out and when I logged back in my offline playlists were deleted. Bug they have to fix.
0,"I was hoping Prime music was going to be the answer to what service I should use since I was already paying for Prime, but it won't work with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 android tablet.  Very disappointed.  Will probably have to go with Spotify."
1,Love it.  This has replaced both Pandora and Spotify on my phone and tablet.  Only negative Lately it has decided to start every newly selected song 10 seconds into song.
0,"does not work in Latin America, other platforms like spotify works well in Colombia, please include amazon music as soon as possible, I probably cancel my prime subscription because amazon music and video does not work in my country"
0,"I say its ok because the app does stream music but,very slow down loadI cant find all the songs that I wantand there's no adequate playlist programIn other words you need to be as good as or better than Spotify"
1,"It's got a good amount of popular songs, and bands on here. It not near Spotify variety, but for casual listening if you alredy have Prime it's definitely an app worth getting."
1,Easy to install and use. Bit limited on range and choice compared to Spotify and Deezer but good value overall
1,Good selection of music. Rivals Pandora and other streaming services because NO ADS. You're already paying for Prime- take advantage of this!
0,I don't think amazon knows yet.  Selection is weak.  Queuing up a play list is clunky and not intuitive.  Get back to me when you guys figure it out as I have Pandora and Spotify and don't have to pay $100/yr to get access.
1,"It took awhile for me to realize that this service was part of Prime. Now that I've been using it for awhile, I feel like a fool for not having used it before! Sure, not every artist is available to stream, but many hours of music are available. The ability to add songs to your library, make play lists and sort by artist, song or genre make this a very usable way to enjoy music. I still listen to Pandora and have found a lot of new music that way. But there is nothing like being able to punch up that perfect song for whatever mood your in, assuming of course it's available"
1,awesome beats pandora by far
0,"When I was told about this opportunity, it didn't faze me until I was shown the range of music to choose from. Pandora was more bothersome but I was able to listen to my favorites with such ease I was amazed. It sent me dancing throughout the house. Thanks I have it on my iPad and Galaxy. Just awesome!"
1,I like that there's not commercials.  Like pandora you can choose or create your stations and skip songs.  It has today's hits which is also nice.
1,"Works really well, but I still stick with Spotify. The app is not as intuitive, and I just love the Spotify run feature"
0,Semi-clunky interface.  Realize that use of this app means being tied to your smartphone/similar.  Amazon doesn't want to become a Pandora and allow streaming through certain electronic equipment.  Until then I'll remain a non-user.
1,"Loaded it on my android phone an removed ten minutes later.  Let me know when there are options available other than POP.  I even looked at the Latin selections, looked pretty miserable.Pandora has it right!"
0,"Excellent Selection, Plays without skips in high quality.  No timeouts.  My opinion is that it's better than Pandora's One (pay version)."
1,"So far, so good. Love that i can listen to my music when im overseas. Pandora does not have this functionality and since i travel frequently ut comes handy!"
1,It has all the bands and songs i like and i can listen wherever i want with no commercials like pandora
1,better than Pandora.  Listening to a lot of music I would not hear otherwise.  thank you !
0,"Doesn't seem like there is very good connectivity.  Stops very quickly when signal strength is low, and does not restart automatically.  Started the same station on a different day and it started with same song as before.  Pandora seems to be a much more robust service.  Wish it was better as I like taking advantage of Amazon Prime services and could see benefits of being connected to Amazon shopping."
0,Maybe it's just me but I don't see how this app does anything but play songs that you already had on your phone and sell new songs to you.  I can't find where it streams anything like Pandora or Rhapsody or iTunes.  What's the big deal?  Why should I use this over the apps I already have?
0,"When you have wifi Its my favorite music app, and just another perk that makes amazon prime great. Seriously hated paying up front but I love it now, pay once get it over with. And use the monthly payment you would have made to save for next year, you will renew. This feature along with all the others makes it worth it. The amount I have saved on shipping alone pays for it. I live in rural northern Minnesota free 2 day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I'm still poor :( but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I don't even download music and I hate him. Let the new guys bitch, you had 30 years prior to make a living."
1,"I like being able to stream whole albums or individual songs on demand. I wish the stations functioned more like Slacker or Pandora, though, and I wish the library of available music was larger."
0,"This app would not work on my RAZRHowever, it works as intended (which is not to say smoothly) on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvementTHE GOOD:*Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently.*I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone.*Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual AppTHE BAD:*Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that.*Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it*Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off This alone is worth 1 star.*I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I don't want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this appYou can do better Amazon"
0,"Convention app but I wish thay had more popular songs on prime. I still use Pandora more, more of a selection, however, you dont know what song is playing next, cant go back or play the same song again."
1,"Bye bye pandora!!!!! Love this app!!! And the best part, no commercials!!!! Love it!"
1,Mildly surprised with the ease of use of Amazon Music. All my past purchases of CDS are incorporated into my account. Much much better than Pandora which I subsequently uninstalled.Good show Amazon!AT
1,"FINALLY amazon prime has brought a perk to my attention that's actually worth having! You have almost completely replaced Pandora, this is a great benefit of Prime."
1,"Can't tell you how great MP3 is. Especially riding the Metra, my cloud, my picks. Puts you in a good zone. Also great for card night. I get to pick the tunes. Nedd to figure out how to delete stuff I don't want. With Pandora, I have a great combo. One to recommend and one to purchase."
0,"The app and selection are OK, no better than any of the other services out there. Since Amazon tries so hard to push Prime down your throat to use this service, I just give my money to Spotify."
1,"Love it. No ads. Can replay songs, have the lyrics, can save favs to playlist. Excellent Prime feature. Haven't played Pandora since."
1,I used to listen to Pandora but now I have switched to amazon music. It's great that it's free with the prime membership!
0,Have had no problems. It is especially nice to have when Internet is slow and Pandora and or iheart radio do not work as this still works. I have used for about w years on a galaxy S3 and just transferred it to a S5 it is still working well.
1,Good overall. Does not has the library as big and varied as Spotify.
0,Spotify is easier to use.
0,"I just started using because it was in my Prime membership. So, why not - right?It surprised me in a good way! The app has been updated, so it runs pretty smoothly in Android. It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect. However, nothing that makes me stop using it.If you're Prime, this is a must use!"
1,"Amazon Music with Prime Music is so much simpler, the library is Fire! I'm ready to cancel Spotify."
0,"My phone like many others have a very limited amount of storage, amazon need to step up and rewrite this app, in the meantime way easier storage manually music on the SD card and/or continue using pandora,spotify/rdio"
0,"I don't like it. It's trying to be the next big thing, but it's confusing to work. I hate Spotify, but even I thin Spotify is better."
1,Best streaming service of its kind. Beats Spotify hands down.
1,I think I have more CDs underneath the seats of my car than albums available on Amazon Music.  The app is garbage.  I went back to Spotify.
0,"App doesn't work on my Android (Samsung Note).  It had worked fine for quite some time and then one day stopped working properly.  I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a joke.  The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version.  It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store.  The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it.  Very frustrating and a big waste of time.  Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff.  This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time.  Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify.  ."
1,Music selection is great but interface is very clunky and not as easy as spotify. Playlist creation is also a chore.
1,"Great, just wish it (Amazon Music) had more of a selection - like Spotify"
0,Keeps crashing Want back to spotify
1,"Wow,  after using Spotify for years I am delighted with this music app.  The Amazon prime free music is pretty great and I really like the playlists"
1,Very nice considering the price and everything else that comes with prime. Not quite as good as Spotify but not far behind.
1,Great selection of prime music. Love it. I use it if someone is using my Spotify.
0,The music library is a little weak compared to Spotify and Google Play Music. They need to step their game up
0,"Doesn't lowers the volume with the GPS like others ( Pandora, spotify etc)"
0,"Awesome and way better than Spotify or Pandora. You dont have to ""pay"" to play your favorite songs."
1,"If you are getting this as an alternative to spotify, get spotify the layout is better and less confusing"
1,I quit using my Pandora and iheartradio when I realized how great it was.  I've had prime for a year.  I wish I'd started using it sooner!
0,This is a big enough problem to cause the application to have a one star rating; Amazon should be able to fix such an issue. Look to google music to rescue us.
