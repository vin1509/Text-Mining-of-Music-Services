1,If you subscribe to any other music service and video service like Netflix or Hulu you're going to kick yourself for the price of commercial free Hulu you can get Amazon Prime which includes all the music you can download or stream all the movies you can watch and free Amazon 2 day shipping all for one low price. Fantastic deal
1,"No commercials - good user interface.  The content is not as broad as Spotify but I found lots of music I like.  Also, Jason Aldean is on Amazon Music but not on Apple's music site."
1,I listen to a wide variety of music. Amazon has a lot.I absolutely love the fact that it's commercial free.I am overall happy with it.Unlike Slacker and iheart where you are limited in use Amazon music gives you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear.
1,I've been using the Amazon music app for my Samsung Note 4 for about a year now.  I love that there are no commercials.  Choosing the prime music to listen to its easy and there are so many choices!  The prime stations have a good variety of music that the station selects for me to listen. I use it almost every day!
1,"A great service.  Prime Music provides easy and ecomical access to a wide variety of music without commercial interruption. Subscribers are able to choose between listening to individual songs, albums, playlists or stations.  A great deal of the music, including the playlists, stations and vintage albums, are available free to Prime Members.  More recent recordings can be sampled and purchased for immediate download."
1,"I am telling everyone I know how amazing the music app is. NO commercials. List to what songs you want, as many times as you want. You do NOT have to listen to music because they want you to. Easy to set up with new releases, or old favorites."
1,"Use it all the time, I love the unlimited skips and no commercials. I find living here on Kauai where cell reception is spotty the fact that the app caches some of the data that's being played I experience no skips in the music that is being played even while dipping in and out of service. Keep up the good job Amazon!"
1,It's great! No commercials. Outstanding sound quality. Numerous choices for songs and playlists.
1,"NO COMMERCIALS!Download this, spend a little time searching for your favorite music and if you are a member of Amazon prime there is a good bit you can save to the cloud for FREE and play anytime WITHOUT COMMERCIALS! the more music and wider variety you add, the more suggestions for new music you will get.  Even has a setting so the only items you will see are FREE with prime.  This app is perfect.Thank you, Amazon."

0,"This service is similar to Pandora however however differs in that it works internationally.  Advertisements that you get in the entry-level service to many free music services are not present in this application.  Though I have not made purchases through the App, operation of the streaming stations is very simple and intuitive."

1,"I love that this is included with my prime membership, the problem with this app is very obvious, the available selection. I'm glad there aren't commercials included."
1,"I like that I can listen to a whole album without commercials,  but listening to a particular genre isn't so easy. It would help to have a seed song that guides the following songs. Also,  not all artists are available,  so it makes getting started a little more troublesome."
1,"Another Excellent benefit of being a Prime member.  No commercials, outstanding choices available,  just wish I could get the app for my Visio smart TV."
1,"Amazon music is better then other app out there. The fact that no commercials or interruptions on stations is great. Lots of options when choosing playlist, and music of choice."

1,"Amazon music is like having a personal, infinite library of just sbout every song in existense with genre shuffle, direct search and NO commercials, no limits on how often you can switch tracks and no constant badgering to upgrade or buy something. Goodbye Pandora!!"
0,"It's okay but only as a secondary music solution for you. First of all, I was super disappointed that ""free music"" really meant ""some free music"". The promotions and even the website make it seem like Prime members have access to full library for free. But then you start searching for songs and see all these price tags. It's super confusing until you realize you only have access to an oddball conglomeration of tunes. Their categories are horrible. I mean, when I see Pop as a category I think it's going to be today's pop music - not Pop songs from decades past. There's no ""today's hits"" section, top 40, or anything like that. And don't get me started on the weird music collections they've assembled. Who are these people who put together playlists? Absolute rubbish. All that aside, if you want to hear some old Journey or AC/DC album in its entirety, you can do that, so there is some value to the service, although if they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear. You could totally survive without this mediocre service."
1,Works much better on my android cell than the other two and no annoying commercials.

1,Quality sound without commercials and good choices. I would like to see more stations posted without having to search.
1,no commercials with prime!!
0,"I have used several music streaming apps in the past.  Amazon music is one of the best, by far.  I am using the basic version, not unlimited.  The fact that there are no commercial interruptions is phenomenal.  I have even managed to convert my kids.  They like it as well.  The search tool works well.  The playlists they have compiled actually match the subject/genre.  Unlike other apps, where there always seemed to be random songs within the playlist that don't belong, each song fits.  The selection is huge, I have only found a few artists/albums that weren't available, or were limited to the unlimited version.  All in all it is a very good music app, and I highly recommend it."
1,"Love the choices, stations, artists and no commercials! Great Music!!"
1,Love that there is no commercials!!! Just another  Amazing offer from Amazon ! Well done
1,Love it! No commercials!
