1,good app
0,"It is lacking many features for sorting or searching for duplicates, etc.  But I'm loving having such a huge library included with my Prime account.  I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see.  I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices.  Been using Prime Music for weeks now with no issues at all."
0,"I've used this app for nearly 2 years and it's been great. I love my Amazon cloud drive and have most of my music uploaded to the cloud drive. Unfortunately, the recent update to this app is broken. If you are listening to music and then go use another app (chrome, facebook, a game, etc.) then the music will randomly stop playing at some point. So, this app is great if you are only going to listen to music and not use your device for any other apps. I'm back to using the system music player for now. My device is a Samsung Galaxy S3.**UPDATE**I tried to create a new review, which doesn't work. Still only 1 star, though, since I can't give the app negative stars.The new Amazon MP3 app is essentially unusable. You've never been able to set the download location to download music to the SD card but at least with the old Amazon MP3 app you could copy downloaded music to the SDCard. This is such a fundamentally flawed design choice that it really makes me question amazon's focus on what customer's want. However, now it's even worse with this new piece of crap app which 1) keeps defaulting to using Prime Music when you open the app (which sucks - I just want to play my music) but, 2) even worse, when you download music and copy it to the SDCard it won't see your music even if it's in the same folder. I've also found, when I did briefly use this new version of the app, that it crashed pretty regularly.I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4.Oh well. At least the Google Music app continues to just work. Can I give that app a 5-star review on Amazon?  "
0,It used to work great until the OS update. I hope they fix it soon. The update makes the app useless.
0,"This app works great Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it doesn't, well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."
1,I adore this app. It is great !
1,Love this app! Tons of music. Easy to navigate around. 5 stars!
1,A great app to use on my android phone and tablet! I love that I can upload my personal library to it and listen to it when I'm on other devices then my computer.
1,I love this app. I am still learning and navigating my way through but it is the only music app I use now! It has a lot to offer!
0,"This was a forced update that if you uninstall it, it removes your amazon app completely.  I lost all of my playlists, and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want.  Too many drop down menus, and too may ads.  And I don't know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want.  Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
0,"This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."
1,"I rate Amazon Music app higher than its two top-rated competitors' apps -- Google Play Music and Audials.  Brilliantly designed user interface that is easy to use and navigate.  Immense library of music.  Also, Amazon Music app works great on Fire tablets and real Android devices, such as Samsung mobile devices.  Amazon nailed it dead-on with its music app.  Woot, Woot, Woot for Amazon!"
1,I love this app. It even works with Alexia.
0,Since the last update I can't get the app to work on my PC at all.  The app slows to a death march speed.  I have removed it from my system.
1,"It's a great app and with Prime Music it became even better.I really wish if I could get access to Prime Music even when I'm not in the US,that's definitely would make it the best music streaming app ever.I contacted Amazon Customers Service and asked them about playing music through Prime Music outside the US.They told me that I must have a credit card issued in the USA in my Amazon account to be able to listen to Prime Music even when not in the US.I have deleted the US credit card and that what caused the problem."
0,I dislike the updated user interface. wish it was more seamlessly integrated into my Toyota in dash audio system. otherwise very very happy user.
1,"Great app, lots of good tunes. So much available for free to prime members!"
0,"Ugh, constant issues with the app not working. I receive an error code on many songs. Reinstall the app, have to reset up all playlists, redownload mp3s, clear cache, etc. and still it tanks. Now I can't even get it to download my purchase album- uuuuggggghhhhhh!!!!!!  I wish it would work as intended, as Prime Music is a great perk assuming we can actually use it as intended."
1,"I use this all the time.  I have the app on my phone so I can take it with me every where I go.  I have found sooo much music from ""back in the day"" that I thought I'd never hear again.  It's much better than listening to the radiono commercials!  It made all my other music apps obsoletejust plain love it!"
1,I love being able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This is a great perk for amazon prime members!We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that runs through the stereo and surround speakers so I can listen while cooking. I also do this in the car.I love all the chanel's offered.
1,"Great app, has plenty of music."
0,I have this on my HTC one M8 and it crashes every few minutes.  I've used it in the past with no issues but with this HTC one M8 it crashes and then wants me to send a report.  Every time this happens it shuts does whatever other program i am using.  GAAAA! HEEEEEEELLLLP!!!YES I have tried updating (doesn't help)YES I have tried to install/re-install (its factory so there is no total uninstall)
0,"the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor.what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload.whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program.realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 months passed and nothing.realy disappointed with amazon. as said in the beguiling im real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this is just CRAP!!!"
1,Love this app. It has so many features.
0,"Regularly crashes and gives errors, I've talked to tech support numerous times, each time it appears to be better for a couple days and goes back to being horribly glitchy and unwieldy.  Sometimes I'll play a song from my device, not even on the cloud, and it will take 10 minutes to load.  Other times, I'll open it and it will immediately crash about 50 times until I can finally start to use it.  I've had this for about a year and had to uninstall/reinstall it probably 30 times because of issues."
1,"Lot of music,  good quality. Desktop app is nice. But can't cast to chrome cast, and not as user friendly when it comes to offline stuff like Spotify."
0,Who needs another worthless waste of space & RAM app?
0,"I have used this app for a couple of years and had no problems with the app till the last upgrade a couple of months ago when the app refused to work on my galaxy s3 after a couple of calls with Amazon Tec support a solution came no closer. I have since upgrade my phone and low and behold all of the Amazon apps work once again. I find the lack of resolve on Amazon tec support rather troubling. All though I was promised to be kept in the loop I never was, not that it matters much anymore since I have a different phone"
0,This app sucks.  I read there is not a charge it's free.  Ya right until you try to download a song.  I wanted to download three or four Christmas songs for our song box to make our lights dance.  It's not like I'm trying to create a music collection or something!!!!!!!!!  Gee wiz
1,Damn good app
1,"I really enjoy the Amazon music app. With the auto-rip feature from Amazon, you get free digital copies of your music on Amazon Music. I also enjoy that I can download songs to listen offline, and that I use SD card storage. Easy to use and very convenient. Would recommend it."
0,Good app but on the blackberry z10 it gives me some trouble but nothing just restarting the app will not fix.
0,"Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime was so totally non-user friendly that I gave up for the second time and got my money back (again). They need to consolidate some things quickly. What a waste of a great idea. You need to fire your head of organizations. When you fix it, please call me. Signed: wish I could have spent my $105.00 dollars."
0,"I love the app when I am using it, but when I am not actively using the app it is still responsible for 25% of the battery drain.  Samsung S7 edge up to date stock.  Fix this unnecessary drain since my guess is the only thing it is doing during non-use is collecting data."
0,"I've used this app in the past without any trouble on my current phone (Motorola Atrix 2) and on a PC and Samsung tablet, but now I cannot get the app to work properly on my Atrix 2.  Logging in just wouldn't happen until I restarted the phone, and after finally logging in, now it won't load my cloud music.  It just cycles with the message ""Loading your cloud music"".  My connection via wifi is good and everything else works just fine.  I'm assuming this is caused by a recent update."
0,This app has worked perfectly for me since I installed it.  I can download music and also stream from my library with no problems.
0,"If an app MUST crash, it should do it once and get it over with. NOT keep bringing up the ""Unfortunately, Amazon Music has stopped"" box over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I couldn't report the crash to Google because the crash box wouldn't stay out of the way long enough to file the report. Couldn't get to the Application Manager to force stop the program because the crash box kept coming up. Deleting this piece of malware NOW."
0,"I downloaded it to my phone, but it won't open. I keep on touching the ""Open"" button on my screen, and nothing happens. Exteremly frustrated, especially after purchasing a song!"
1,"Great app! I cannot live without my amazon music. You can shop, create play lists and will show up as apart of your regular music app that's on your phone. Keep in mind you can do most of this but I do have prime which may be allowing me to do all of these things."
0,Terrible interface. Horrible when driving. Terrible blue tooth compatibility.  Playlists dont always transfer.  Terrible ability to scan for new music. Synching sucks. Slow as hell. A failure and disgrace for amazon.
0,Worst app and service ever there is never any good music to download without paying for it. I would be upset but its included in prime.
0,my biggest problem with this app is that it continually puts me on a screen wanting me to choose PRIME music. WHY IS THERE NOT AN OPTION TO SAY NO??? I don't have the access to internet that it would need to run it. Some of us don't live in a city where it's everywhere. I live in a rural area and my satellite internet is so much data per month. That's it. So PLEASE give an option to opt out of that without continually being routed back to that screen.
1,The best music app I've ever had! I have access to everything except for new dropped albulms which is fine because I can either wait or upgrade my subscription. Plus no ads it's straight to the next song and skip as much as you would like !
0,"I'm Amazon stuff all the way. But for the life of me I cannot get the Cloud to open with this application. Downloaded smoothly, icon on the screen, opens my device stored music list. But when I try to open the cloud, I get ""Exception #151"" and connection error. I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open, but to no avail. So, I've written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!"
1,"Loved the app until the update that took the option to use it with ford sync, I hope they bring that feature back"
1,"This app is great, easy to use, and does everything I need it to. I just wish I could search through the music store and buy music without having to change apps."
1,"The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate, and it does what it should. Performance though is a problem. I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use."
0,"This app hasn't blown me away or anything, but it does what it is supposed to. I ended up deleting it off my phone, but that wasn't because it was a bad app. My phone just doesn't have a lot of storage so if I find an app that I do not use often, I quickly delete them."
0,"Great app. Just a small problem with offline music - online music that I download to listen to offline sometimes doesn't actually ""download"". Even though it's check-marked as downloaded, it won't let me play it and it gives me that annoying ""Internet connection required"". It's happened on my Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and an LG phone. Sometimes the lyrics are not on sync as well, or the art cover gets stuck for one song and the app 'freezes' (it keeps playing music but I cannot tap anything) a bit, then displays it correctly"
0,"I have had this app for about 3 weeks and it continues to disappoint. Below are my major complaints.Won't shut off - if I pause the music, ope  my recent apps and click the &#34;x&#34; button to close the app 9/10 times the music player opens itself back up, i have to do this 3 or 4 times to get it to close.Downloading music - it is great that you can download the Prime music, that is an awesome feature, however, if you only want certain songs from an album and you stop the other songs from downloading, the downloadet pops up everytime you use the app. It says the downloads are paused even though i have canceled the dow loads 12 times.  I do not have unlimited data and do not want every song from the albums in question. On the topic of downloading songs, if you search for albums or songs and download them to your phone, often times it will not show them as in your library when you search again, so you can end up downloading several copies of the same song/album. There is not consistency between the music store and your local library.Glitchy - the app will often glitch when opening or closing and will not respond to commands. I have attempted two reinstalls and still no luck.Amazon really needs to get their heads together and fix this app, it has a lot of potential, but sucks the big one right now."
0,"The interface is not as intuitive to use in my opinion.  I have one album downloaded, and I have to search for the album to play in its entirety."
0,This app is 10 times better the the Google music app much easier to navigate
0,"The app is preset to download updates even if you are on your 4G and ignores the regular android settings of no large downloads except over 801 wireless. Chewed up MULTI-MEGABYTES over 4G before I realized what it, and it's companion apps, had done and how to turn it off. Total BS that they don't set the default update setting to ""Only over wireless"""
1,I went from play music to this. This app needs more functions to be a good music player.
1,"This is the best app, I listen to music everyday, even when I am exercising. Or riding in the car."
0,"The app turns my boring phone into a music making machine, however, the app drains the battery more than any other app I have installed.  Given this only drawback, it is still way better than any other music app, even though I'm paying for this service and most of the other music apps are free."
0,"This app sucks. If you've downloaded music to the app, you won't get it to your phone storage (sd card ) so friggin user unfriendly. I hate it"
1,Well worth getting prime just for the music! I plug my phone up to my AUX cord and listen to all my favorite music. Simple and easy interface!
1,"Huge selection, and great audio quality.  The user interface is a bit perplexing, and takes some getting used to, and that is why i didn't give it 5 stars.  Otherwise great app!Example of the difficult user interface, Hard to find equalizer settings, forward/rev/play buttons sometimes hide depending on the screen.  I think it would be nice if those adjustment controls would be fixed regardless where you navigate."
1,"slow Not Responding poorly performing software free with Prime, but poorly executed. Oh and content no longer available  kiss my assish. He's the guy that wrote the code"
0,"The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud  service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix."
0,bloated unfriendly interface nearly as bad as iTunes since deleted will never reinstall or buy music from amazon again
1,I like this app better than Google Play Music.Easy to use with a simple interface.  This app runs perfectly on the Acer Iconia Tab A110-07g08u 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Gray).
0,"The app I hate the most.  Terrible user interface.  Would not let me play music I downloaded to my phone from Amazon Music without signing in with my e-mail address and password. HUH?!  This was finally fixed in an update, but still horrible, tiny menus that can not be read at a slight distance (I.E. used in a car) and are completely un-intuitive.  The app will ALWAYS try to play Prime Music streaming instead of music on your phone.  Hello wasted data $$$.  Some artists/songs that I purchased do not show up in different views (title/genre/artist/album). The original app was fine, when Prime Music was added they ruined it."
1,Interface is easy to use.  There is a pretty good selection of music with the prime membership.
0,"it plays music well, selection seems to be pretty good, and eventually you can find what you want, but the dark and crowded navigation screens are hard to use in the car/bus/train.  it also takes too many clicks to get to where you want to be.suggestions:- completely mute (or pause) the music when a text or other notification comes in, or when the GPS tries to talk - right now i can't hear most text notification sounds over the music, and can just barely hear the GPS directions (google maps) over the music.- add optional light/dark themes to fit different peoples' tastes and environments- add a FAVORITES section so i can have all my stations, playlists, tracks, etc in one place instead of scattered all over.  more than once i've had to really search around for a station i had listened to a while ago, that was no longer listed in ""recents"".- add a CAR MODE with bigger buttons/text so it's easier to use - this would be especially useful for those of us with android car stereo units like this one: HIZPO Quad Core Android 5.1 Car DVD GPS for Toyota RAV4 2006-2012 with 1024x600 Capacitive Touchscreen support Steer Wheel Control Screen Mirror OBD2 TV DVR Stereo Bluetooth SD USB Radio Player"
0,"very slow and dose not work well on one of my tablets, clunky interface. but has potential. get idea and looking forward to updates"
1,"I love this app! The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside, it's one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there."
1,Really wish they the interface was better made
1,"Nice, neat, easy to understand interface. A fairly good collection of music. A Great addition to Amazon's growing number of quality services."
0,"It used to be a workable app, but pushing prime up front makes it a pain to just listen to music on my phone. I tried one &#34;Prime&#34; song today and it played ok, but if I paused or tried to switch songs it didn't respond, then after several tries it would perform the actions I'd tried in order sometimes 20+ seconds apart, so the track would go back to the start and play for a little while and start over, then it would play a little and switch to the previous track, then after a bit the track before that.  Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame! Plus since this is such a big overhaul of the app it shouldn't have the benefit of a couple of years worth of 3, 4 and 5 star reviews. This makes me think twice about even listening to my own music because I don't want the frustration!"
0,clunky interface.  limited products to choose from.  Don't bother
1,"I like the performance of the app on my Android phone and the music selection. Big plus (vs youtube, etc. at least for me as a Republic Wireless user), is that it seems to use WiFi and no cell data."
1,Nice interface and good selection but not available on enough products. I would like to be able to use it on my smart TV or XBox One.
0,"It does provide access to the massive online selections, but it really does drain your device.  Always running and killing your performance/battery. Force stopping it is a temporary measure at best since it always pops back up.  Linked to the amazon store app, and altogether, they are a mess."
1,Easy to use and a great selection of music.
0,No issues with this app. Seems to work fine and is fairly intuitive. No negative impacts on phone performance that I have noticed YET. Hope it will continue to work nicely!
0,"The interface is lacking, and the whole &#34;cloud or device&#34; thing is confusing. The navigation around the app shouldn't just default to albums. And it won't read any audio from an SD card, so if I put a bunch of music on a card it is invisible."
1,Very nice selection of music and I love the lyrics that play right along.
0,"I appreciate the Prime music, but streaming the songs can be very spotty, and skip. If I resort to downloading the songs, then I have no issues. Other than that, it's a simple app that could use some performance improvements."
1,This is a nice and easy way to listen to your music. The interface is simple to use and is a must use for your daily music needs.
0,"I haven't used this service much so my impressions are just prreliminary.  The interface is not intutive and there doesn't seem to be much help.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I was unable to locate music that should have been obvious.  The Beatles, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, etc.  The music that seem to come up in the playlists is all new (2000 to now) stuff that I've never heard of.  Not that I stay on top of modern music much (I'm 61).  I might fool around with it some more to make sure I'm not doing something wrong but if I can't get the music I'm interested in I don't see the point.  I already have Pandora and all my music library on my phone.  I appreicate it that Amazon gave us Prime members something for free but for me the jury is still out on how much a benefit it will be."
0,"This application is fantastic.  Not only does it ease the navigation of Prime music, it has a clean interface, and music plays from your library as if it were stored locally (broadband connection dependent, of course).Well done Amazon!"
0,"I find the interface convoluted, vague and confusing. Once I get a file selected to play then it is fine but the whole app should be revised."
0,"I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums."
0,"Hard to use interface for searching for tunes, and collection seems to be lamely curated."
1,"The interface needs some fine tuning and finding songs or searching through the library on my phone or tablet is okay, but could be much better."
1,Simply wow!!! User friendly interface easy to use and above all comes with my prime membership
0,Not a fan of the interface
0,"Not a very friendly user interface.  Takes too long to figure out how to properly use.  Has only playlists, so you cannot create channels."
0,"It performs well, and being able to access the cloud across multiple devices is really nice. It needs to have the option of storing purchased content on an SD card rather than on the device's internal memory. Aside from that, it performs very well and worth downloading."
0,The app does what it's supposed to; play music.  I don't have any performance problems with the phone as others stated.
1,In my experience better performance than Google music and Spotify. Love unlimited skips.
1,"Ugliest interface ever.  Amazon is rich, they should be able to find a designer with more talent."
0,It crashes all the time on my android pad [kit-kat]
0,Apps inside of apps on Android causes crappy experience.
0,This app plays songs well. Unfortunately it is a memory hog that stays on in the background and has to be force closed to shut down. Deleting it.
1,Simple to use interface and works great.
1,really could use a better interface
1,"Love the music, but not completely happy with the players performance"
1,Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too cant go wrong get this doit just do it
0,"Works seamlessly with the widget on an AT&T Galaxy S II.  Setup was very easy, and performance is fine on 3G or higher.  Nice work, and keep it up!"
0,Great app! Works well on my tablet. My Google Play doesn't always work. Will download more from Amazon apps. No problems found at all.
0,This app isn't working. I've downloaded and deleted then downloaded again and still won't work!
1,"This app is great, easy to use, and convenient! I can listen to my favorite songs anywhere, anytime. This is the best app I will ever download on my phone! Music is life! \m/"
0,This is a fantastic APP. I have downloaded all my favorite music and grouped them based on what I am doing so it makes for perfect music grooves for any occasion. All for free too!
0,Continuosly crashing to point it seemed to uninstall itself & now can't reinstall.
0,This app is amazing. It does not require data after songs are downloaded to the phone. This help when I want to listen to music without draining my battery!
0,"Using Android app on Samsung S4TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free.  Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.Pros :Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon appManaged playlists are nice, good varied selectionLots of good music in thereCons :Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library - no way to disable this - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again) - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scanNo way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely.Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks.No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as : - specify download location - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music - disable device scan"
1,"Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available.  However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent.  The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms.  Play queue being an example.  The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling.  I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist.  Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums.  This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application.  This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application.  This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks.  The ability to thumbs up / down  or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms.  If I find a new bandI would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow.  It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing.  This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to  Show me similar artist, records, songs.  Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10.  Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature.  However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11.  Android Screen controls.  The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android.  There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).Overall the service is adequate.  There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market.  I signed my family up for a year.  They all hate it!  We will give the service a fair shake over the year.  If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again.  I expected better from Amazon.  Okay is not good enough."
0,"Latest version is horrible. Performance is worse and the app is now buggy. The UI hasn't improved and think it is worse than previous version. They also got rid of some features like adding song to playlist directly from song vs. now having to edit through the playlist. Good job Amazon, guess will now have to look for a new player."
1,"Love the app. I like that I can turn off my screen and still listen on my Android. Also, I like that I can add a play list online with Prime which I think is easier on the computer. Can swipe down or hit the screen on for pause option. Nice!"
0,"The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I don’t need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. You’d think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players don’t seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression."
1,"I love Amazon Music it is a great app I love the simplicity of this app and the large selection to choose from , love being able to download Performance Tracks . This is a must keep for us"
0,"I wanted to like this app. I liked being able to download music to my phone that I got through amazon prime for free. I was also able to import my music from my SD Card into it and create playlists. Great. The app seemed to perform well, however it DRAINS BATTERY like no other in the background.  I went through amazon support for this and they recommended I uninstall and reinstall the app so I did. Same problem. Amazon Music was using a large % of CPU even ever closing the app. Support told me I needed to force close it. How about coding a quality app that I don't need to force close, Amazon?  For the record I only ever listed to music that was local to my device. Never streamed music."
1,"Android app used to work great, then one day it started getting a Playback Error suggesting that the downloaded Amazon mp3's were corrupt or an unsupported format (Exception #171). Very strange since these are Amazon's own mp3's. Even more odd, the mp3's are all playable using Google Play!"
0,I'm Making this review via Amazon Fire phone FireIOS 4.6.3 so that apps performance is amazing no memory issues however why pay for access to stale music that could be streamed on hundreds of sites for free so I've decided not to renew Prime next year Why are They're 2 Amazon apps that do the same thing on my device anyway?
1,I like this Amazon Music app and use it almost daily.  Great performance with out any annoyances.  5 stars for now.
0,"Sucks.  For $99/year, add a song to your playlist, try to play and all you get is a message ""can't perform function now,try back latter"""
1,Easy to use and select the music for my playlist.
0,I can't get to my songs in the cloud because the app is fubard and thinks I'm in the UK. I live in LA. Please fix this.
0,"This downloading application has literally taken 5 hours to download ten songs.  There is no problem with my internet, I have the most recent version- it's just an awful application."
1,Good app and glad it is available with Prime.
1,I love this app. It works exactly like it should. It's easy to buy music and to download songs from the cloud drive to my phone. It's also fast and there's like zero load time at all. Once I get all my music on the cloud drive I'll probably use this more than my iPod.
