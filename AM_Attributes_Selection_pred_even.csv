Seems that Amazon would put more effort in their prime video service (which is still very limited and lacks the selection of their competitors) instead of launching additional services.  Just seems a little backwards to me, but I won't complain about something free!!"
1,"Wonderful selections, great sound.fantastic Prime benefit."
1,Selection is good for the type of music i preferEasy to search and download
0,"CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to look for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is)."
1,"I am very impressed with the selection and the quality or music!  I have just started using this service,  but from what I can tell---it is absolutely top notch!  An endless selection of artists stations as well.  Great job Amazon!"
1,really great selection & gteat to have all in 1 place.
1,"The app itself could be easier to navigate, but I'm still going to give it a high rating because if I hear a new song on the radio I have not had a problem also getting to listen to that song on this app for free. Anyway, it's not a perfect interface but they make up for by giving a great selection of music."
1,Good music selection.  No streaming issues.
1,Love Amazon music. If you have prime there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have this app and shouldn't be using. This works fantastic with Alexa and has a great selection of music.
1,The selection is incredible. The quality is top notch. Classical bundle varieties very educational.
1,"Love it!!! Excellent music selection from every conceivable genre and no commercials!!! My only minor issue is that two family members cannot stream prime music from the cloud at the same time. However, you can still listen to downloaded music/playlists while another streams from the cloud. Amazing benefit of the Prime Membership."
1,"We only use it occasionally, mostly for Beatles stuff.  Much smaller selection of music than Spotify."
1,"It was easy to browse through all the songs and pick out those I wished to include in playlists, then used Bluetooth to play on my boat.  The selection is somewhat limited, but still had plenty of variety.  Wish there were some Jimmy Buffet songs to pick, but only knock-offs.  Fairly intuitive, one-button play for each playlist - hopefully the available music list will grow!"
1,"Don't have many selections for what I looking, also is required to pay for prime members."
1,Hard to get to the music difinitely not user friendly Very limited selection of music in the playlist/genere I'll stay with Pandora
1,Listen to the Prime Stations daily with no problem. Good selection of music from many genre
1,Really like this app.  I like being able to listen to my selections while I am working on the computer.  I have a bluetooth device that pairs my hearing aids with my computer.  I can hear the music just fine but no one else does!!  Haven't had time yet to explore all of the music available.  Looking forward to doing it!!
1,The streaming music and video services of Amazon are worth the annual fee. It is like the free 2 day shipping is just a nice additional bonus!The music selection and sound quality are very good. I get a few skips and drops on occasion but that is the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.
0,Amazon has an extremely limited selection of music compared to Google play music. I tried prime just for streaming music selection trying to save $30/year on music subscription but with the poor selection on Amazon I'm gonna stick with Google.
0,"Music plays well, but no way to rate songs in the mobile app. The music selection is very limited and by no way competes with Google Music."
1,"Loving my Amazon Music! It's my favorite music app and I use it all the time, both for my own collection and to streaming. Super selection of available music. I really like that I can download so many of my favorites for free. Pretty awesome! I feel like I get my moneys worth with my Prime membership with so many benefits available. One of my smarter investments."
1,"Awesome app. Love, love, and more love. Gives you the ability to download the playlists and skip anything you wantwith no commercials. You can even randomize the playlists, and more. I just turn on Bob Marley's greatest hits by the pool. If you're a Prime member, there's a MASSIVE selection of music that iswait for itcompletely and totallyFREE!"
1,I love Amazon Music all I have to do is click on the icon pick one of the many free downloads of music I have picked and sing and soar off into dreamland.All you have to do is select a song or artist and scroll thru the many selections of songs for that artist. Thanks Amazon I love you guys the best thing that has happened since I've been a member. Lady Gee
1,"I am such a huge fan of amazon prime music. I have used other programs in the past, but the selection is hard to beat. I love using the different study mixes as I prepare lectures. My favorite part is the lack of commercials and a price tag seeing as it is included with my prime membership!"
1,"It's a nice service, but the selection is limited. And it changes. You could put a song in your playlist today, and tomorrow the rights are pulled and you can no longer access that song or that album.  I also find the phone app really annoying and difficult to navigate."
1,"I have really enjoyed using amazon music with prime membership. Good selections and variety. I love ALL that prime membership has to offer. The 2 day shipping, amazon video, and music. It's a no brainer for me. Amazon is my GO TO spot for all my needs"

0,"The good: It installed easily and doesn't crash my Android 2.3 phone (LG MyTouch Q).The not-so-good: Mediocre variety and selection of music, at best. No obvious way to use Amazon.com MP3 credits. No idea what happened to the song I selected and thought I downloaded."
1,Love it! Music selections is unlimited

1,Great selection of music and no ads!
0,Not all of the artist I would prefer but a large selection of music. I have had issues with the Amazon player having static and cut out from time to time. Would prefer ability to use the phones media player but understand why that is not an option.

Thanks for yet another benefit of Prime membership."
1,I love the selection that you get
1,Excellent music selection. We can even download for offline use.
1,"Great selection, great quality, lacks ""radio station"" like ability.  So I can select a bunch of stuff to ""add to my selection"" but I can't (or can't find it) select a simple set of music (ie Genre) to play or stream like a radio.  However, I do love itit's become my go to music source"
1,I've only been using for a few days but so far it is the best music app I've used. Great selection easy to use and I love you can see the lyrics.
0,This app alone is worth paying for a Prime membership if you're a music lover! Use this all the time! Amazing selection. I quit using the other music app that shall not be named after getting this.
1,"Great selection of music and streaming is on-par with Pandora, Spotify and Slacker premium services and what I pay basically gives me free Prime Video and shipping as a benefit."

1,Great selection of music. Love Amazon Music! Great streaming quality no interruptions.
1,"Have found new music, as well as most of my old favorites.The play lists are great too.So Much music, so little time! I bet if I turned my selections on and just let them play it would take days to finish. Just love that!Thank youCheers"
1,I like the amount of genres selection.
