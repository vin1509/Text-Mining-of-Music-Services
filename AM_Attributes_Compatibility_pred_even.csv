0,"We have tried using this on several different devices thinking that maybe that the app was just not working with the device (yes, we know only 1 device at time). However, the shuffle doesn't really 'shuffle', the music will just stop without notice, and the Prime music to the computer and the Prime music to the device do not sync.Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts."
0,"I have Amazon Prime, but the app would never give me the option to sign in. Also the music downloader wouldn't work in chrome on my PC and even the music I took the time to put in the cloud would not show up in the app. I deleted because it would not work on my device. LG G2. I feel like it might have been a good app if I could have gotten it to work right, just based on what I saw. This is the first app I've had trouble with."
0,I love amazon Prime Music. The only reason why I give it four stars is because I can't access it on my other devices and also not with our Fire TV device.
0,Doesn't work with Nougat.
0,"On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play songs from Prime Music. Before the upgrade, I used this app extensively, and liked it. It now either freezes, crashes, or freezes and crashes every time I try to play any of the Prime Music songs. The songs in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially, Prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment, and the app upgrade has broken the app. Well played!"
0,"This new update will not play music if no cell or Wi-Fi is available. My music is on my device and all I get is the rotating circle looking for service. However, I can play music through Google player, or the device's music player.I didn't even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often, I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re-download all my music. Before, I would pull my SD card, reset phone, and re-mount the SD card  continue listening to music.Not happy!"
0,Would NOT play audio on android. Show that it's playing but NO! audio. Tried everything to no avail. Even reformatted device and still no audio!  DISSAPOINTED!
0,"Could not make this App work on my device, canceled the order."
1,I love Amazon music period. On any device it is awesome.
1,i have always loved Amazon Music and used it on my Kindle every day for years.  I have bought thousands of songs through it and now it's NOT COMPATIBLE with my Kindle or Amazon TV Stick.  What's the point of having Amazon Prime if I can't even use it on my Amazon devices.
1,"Love buying a single song, accessing from any device, and getting my worship on!"
0,"I tried to download to my BB via amazon apps and amazon mobile. No luck so, had to use a mirror to download.The app is great, but since it is android and not BB, there is a hiccup once in a while that causes it to crash. Otherwise, the sound quality at the highest level (in a compatible wi-fi environment) is fantastic, and it's better than having to listen to pandora or spotify with their commercials."
0,"I installed this App on both a Samsung smart phone and tablet.  Initially, I found the instructions a little confusing.  It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with.  While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices.  An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it.  So far it is working well without too much difficulity."
0,Well with the latest update this app is no longer compatible with my phone. It would be great if the old version were available so I could download and play the music I purchased without having to buy yet another phone. I understand that the addition of prime music might necessitate an upgrade but locking me out of music I paid for is very disillusioning.
1,I love being able to use Prime on all our devices!!
1,Love the music app I can take my music anywhere I go on all my devices
0,Puts songs directly onto device storage. Needs an option for putting music directly onto the SD card. I've been downloading a few songs at a time and transferring them - a slow process. As for Prime music - it seems to hide it on the device storage with no way of moving to the CD card - My phone was running out of storage until I realized this.
0,"1. Not compatible with Samsung S7! I had to try very hard to install.2. Loaded music for some reason is divided into many categories for 2-3 songs. This is inconvenient, leave it as it is on the SD-card!"
0,I am not able to get my Android device to play anything on Amazon Prime Music.  My PC does fine though
1,"Love the service, hate this app. Constantly hangs on startup on my LG G3. Just loads and loads, have to shut it down, disable data, reopen and listen to device music. Can't get it to stream properly over Mobile Data, just Wi-Fi"
1,I am able to find almost any song I can think of and I am able to listen to the music on any of my devices. I just start at one song and let it play from there
0,No longer compatible with my device so I can't give it anymore than one star.  Was awesome when it worked though.
1,"We use this app all the time.  Absolutley love it and love the fact that it is airplay compatible.  Never have had any issues and the county, pop and top 40 stations are free, no commercials and play great music"
0,"Well-intentioned but definitely seems to be in a beta version if you will. Could use a car mode, voice commands, and compatibility with S-voice and/or car mode on Samsung Galaxy for optimum usefulness. Thankful for this arm of the Amazon Prime experience!"
0,"Works on most major devices, but if you have an esoteric device (e.g. Oneplus One), it may not work.There are a bunch of issues with the app, including:- local download process is buggy, some playlists freeze midway through downloads and the notification doesn't disappear without a way to fix it- the license check process sometimes locks you out, especially if you tend to only use the app when you know you'll be offline (like on a plane ride)- the genres are way too specific- the flow of the app was really unintuitive but has now gotten much better - the navigation could use some improvement, there's too much relegated to the left sidebar and few ways to jump around the app from within the main frame- the biggest issue to me, is that I'd love to use this to cache music but use another player to play it - unfortunately, this is blocked"
0,"2 stars. I love music. I had this app on an android phone and it had no SD support. Which made it useless since most android phones have what like 4 gb of internal storage. I've tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I'm one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I'm lucky the music will start up again with no interaction (like its buffering and this isn't me streaming. I playing the music I ""downloaded""). I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place."
1,"Was working great on my Blackberry Z10 until Amazon recently outlawed it for our devices! C'mon, Amazon! Why the hate for Blackberry?!? The app works great with 10.2.1 and with 10.3.1 on the Z10. Please re-enable this app for Blackberry users!!!"
1,"I really like this app. It has a lot of great features. I really enjoy the option of playing the music directly on the app, as well as downloading the music to your device. I actually use another app for playing the majority of my music on my phone, so the ability to download the music is great! And it downloads in a generic file type so that it is compatible with other programs.Amazon also offers the same app for download to your computer. That app is excellent! It offers the option to download and automatically add to iTunes."
0,The app keeps giving a 505 exception error and will not update. I have called customer service and they could not help even completed  factory data reset on my Android device. The app itself is good but won't last long if I can't update
1,Never a problem. This application works great on all device
0,"My Android tablet (HTC Jetstream) originated in Canada but is in use in the United States since it's purchase.  This app is for the English language only if it is either United States or United KingdomNOT Canadian English.  I'm sure it doesn't take a lot of work to add Canadian English to the list of recognizable languages.  Since I cannot modify my device's language, my only hope is that someone at Amazon will fix this small-to-you-but-huge-to-me problem."
0,I can't download it on my phone lost all my music that never downloaded onto my ad cardHow can a s 7 galaxy not be compatible. Amazon u lost a good customer
0,amazon prime video is incompatible with my Android TV box.
0,"Installed update on working MP3 install on Nexus 7. No longer works. Hangs on continue. Moto Droid X2 updated OK, so has an issue with the tablet."
0,Not working well with Samsung Galaxy S5
0,"It's ok, but only for the one person in the household who registered prime to their email address. Also, the biggest negative for me is that its not compatible with Sonos which I'm invested in at my home."
1,"decent selection of music, streaming is limited.  Frustrating (and infuriating) that it's not compatible with Chromecast.Good for road trips if you have the data."
0,I got this app because it allows me to import my music to my android for use with a ringtone converter. (I can't upload with USB because I can't find a compatible data cable.)  The bonus is that it plays my music loud enough to actually hear without headphones.  The only downside is that the free app is limited to only 250 songs.
0,"Is Amazon serious??  An Amazon product incompatible with an amazon app.  A laptop gets more attractive every day.  VERY disappointed, Amazon."
0,"Contrary to Amazon's claims this app is not compatible with the Acer A510.  There is no access to playing music from ""the cloud"".  I can browse my music and purchase music but forget playing music.Update - Turns out the issue is with the device.  A reboot and the app works fine.  This is also the case with a few other apps that were included on the device.  So I'll be knocking a star of my Acer review."
0,"I've install and uninstalled many times and it won't open. Never had this problem with old version. Left email, received an answer but still not working.  Just want to be able to load music on my MP3 so I can exercise.  Now I have to find another music store that works for me."
1,"Maybe the app is good, maybe it isn't--Amazon Prime Music isn't designed to be compatible with my older Android device and Spotify is, so that makes for an easy decision. If you're interested in subscribing to Prime based on the music service, be sure to check your specs."
0,This app is not compatible. I downloaded it but it won't play any music. I have to save the music from amazon music to my phone and play it on the phones music player. Very disappointed. This phone is not old it's new in 2014.
0,had issues with poor reception on LG phone. Now incompatible with Samsung phoneFRUSTRATIONNow Amazon account still reflects LG phone and won't update with new Samsung infomore FRUSTRATION Now I can access music from cloud but only on pc then must transfer  more frustration and irritation
0,"When I ordered this app I thought it was compatible with my Kindle Fire HD.Unfortunately it wasn't,  none the less to my surprise it works great on my smart phone!  The loss of one star is for not being compatible with my Kindle Fire.  I do recommend this app for any smart phone with  the Android operating system!  "
0,"I used to have this app on my kindle fire hd and loved it. I want it on my HDX, but when I try to download it, I get an error message that it's not compatible. Anyone else have this problem? Anyone know a solution? Only have it one star because it won't let me download it!"
1,"UI is very confusing and poorly laid out!  Needs a drastic improvement.  Song library is pale in comparison to the major apps Pandora, slacker, spotify.  Hopefull it will get better."
0,It is supposed to be Android compatible but it doesn't work on my phone. I'll admit I have an older phone 2-3 year old HTC Thunderbolt running Cyanogenmod 7.1.1 and it loaded Amazon MP3 player instead. So I cannot use this app at all.
0,not compatible with kindle fire
0,"Not very useful, does not work or compatible on all of the Amazon devices.  Kind of strange Amazon would develop something that does not work on all of their devices.  But this is what I have come to expect."
0,Just updated the Amazon prime music appI have messages now that on my Amazon Kindle Fire Hd that it is incompatibleSeriously..??On a Kindle Fire HD..???It has stopped working
0,"I was excited to try Amazon Prime, but was disappointed to find out I couldn't watch any movies or read kindle books without having any of the compatible devices.  If you have an android device this isn't for you."
0,I have triple checked the compatibility but it errors out when I try to install. I had to write this review on a PC as it won't even allow me to review the app on my device until I have successfully installed it. So there's probably a whole lot of people out there in the same boat who can't review because they can't install.
1,"This app flawlessly delivers 50% of the Amazon cloud-based multimedia world.  In order to rate any higher, it would also need to address Prime video as well, but alas, Android and Prime video are incompatible."
0,"Poor audio quality on the Device, I am no sure if my android phone Samsung Mega is not compatible,  but my albums down loaded play to the cloud plays awesome"
0,Is not working with my new cell LG V-10
0,I just bought a Kindle hd and this is not compatible. I thought Kindles would be a sure thing. I can load it on my tablet but not my kindle??
0,Not working Saudi arabia
0,5 stars if compatible with fords mysync but it isn't
0,Not working outside the US. Useless.
1,lacks some features and has compatibility issues but it is free if you have prime so I can deal
0,"Pure failure. It failed to run with a Force Close error the first launch and every time since. It says it's up to date, so it musr be incompatible with the Samsung Galaxy S2I would rate it a zero!"
1,Easy to select music.  Unable to use my Android device - not compatible but no further explanation.
0,it does not start!!! i want to buy a song from MP3not working NEXUS 7 i tryed several times. finally unintalled it.
1,"Love the selections and the price!! Compatible with Itunes and easy to use. Would use this as much as possible, definitely check price before you buy elsewhere."
1,This is a great player and is compatible with the music I have on the popular i player and i store.
1,"It works great~ but I hope other language works, too. Korean is not compatible with it.. Keep up the good work!"
0,Why is it not compatible with my Pandigital Tablet?
0,"There is absolutely no mention that this new Prime Music Application will not work with the 1st Generation Kindle Fire.  After screwing around with my Kindle for  hours I spent another hour on the phone talking a total of four people from Amazon before I was finally told "" your device is not compatible with this update and you need to buy a new Kindle"".  WTF!!!!  I am very disappointed with Amazon and the deliberate omission of this piece of very important information.  If you are monitoring this Amazon, you dropped the ball and I will buy an Apple Ipad before I spend another dollar on any of your devices."
0,"Broke will not work on Samsung Galaxy Note. Tried Google play and Amazon apps, Google says it's already downloaded (it's not) and Amazon says it's incompatible Seriously, WTF?"
0,"Amazon needs to make some major improvements to their Amazon Music App on the Kindle Fire series.  It does not work well offline (appears the buffer memory is way too small).  Besides not working well offline, you have to actually tell the Kindle Fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online How stupid is that?  Can't Amazon's own app on it's own name brand device figure out if it is connected to WiFi or not and function accordingly?  I love the Amazon Music service concept, but the Amazon Music App currently is so sub-par.  In addition, when the Amazon Music App crashes, you literally have to reboot by turning off the Fire and then turning it back on again.  On both my Apple and other Android-based devices, in the rare instance that an app does crash, you can wait a few seconds and then just re-launch it.  Not so with Amazon Music.  To shame!Also, it appears that the Amazon Music App has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards.  I have had Amazon Music crash and then my Fire HD 8 suddenly can't read my name-brand 64GB SDHC card after the Amazon Music App crashed.  I've had this behavior happen many times Then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card (and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen) again.  And then the Fire HD 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days, usually as long as Amazon Music App doesn't crash out again!!!  So that tells me it's not a bad memory card at all Somethings wrong with Amazon's app / device.Overall, the Fire HD 8 Tablet seems to be an excellent low-priced tablet, but the Amazon Music App and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me.  Amazon, you're better than this, right?  Get your device and app teams to fix this or I'm moving to Spotify and likely never coming back!"
0,"Great job. Promote your new prime music and make the player incompatible with older hardware (2 year old phone and first generation Kindle). It has speakers, it has a audio jack, Pandora, Slacker, everything else works on it. Guess I will say screw it to Amazon Prime Music and stick with tried and true music players that don't give me a hassle.Be warned, if you don't like spending several hundred dollars every year to upgrade your tech then you wont like this application because it wont like your perfectly good hardware. Way to be like Apple Amazon."
0,"UNBELIVEABLE! The Amazon Music App will not install on my 2015 Amazon Fire tablet or original Fire TV! When I try the Amazon product page says it's not compatible. Argh!The product listing says it only requires Android 4.1 and both my Fire tablets and Fire TV have been updated to have OS versions based on Android 4.1 or newer. I'm blocked from even purchasing it (at $0 of course). Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!Maybe I shouldn't complain as the old app works fine for me. On the other hand a lot of good music seems to be disappearing from Prime music and I expect the added cost music subscription may be needed in the future to get good tunes. Just feeling a little dark at a good thing like prime being eaten away in parts I care about.I hope Amazon isn't blocking all older devices from new apps. That would be bad. I'm giving this app only 1 star till this gets resolved, if ever."
0,This app is compatible with neither my Kindle Fire nor my Android phone.  An Amazon app that doesn't even work with a nearly new Amazon device?  Inexcusable.
0,"I do like the ability of getting music w/my Prime acct. That said there are a few time that need to be changed in order to make it better. First allow the app &/or music to be saved to the SD card.  When my phone updated to marshmallow it wiped all my music (whether this is an Android or Amazon issue idk), but everything on my SD card was saved. Second, make it easier to download music. I can't afford to burn through my data, streaming music. Last (again going back to marshmallow update), make sure your app is compatible w/the newest upgrade. Since marshmallow I can't update your app. I keep getting the 505 error code even after clearing the cache & data from both Prime & Google Play Store. This means I need to uninstall the app and will loose all my music on my device because I can't save it to my SD card. If I'm suppose to be able to receive music because I pay for a service I should have the ability to download and save"
0,"This is the sorriest excuse for a music app that I have ever seen!  According to Amazon, the Android version of the app is compatible with my Fire tablet, but strangely enough, not with my Android phone.  I am about to embark on a cruise trip, and wanted to have the music I purchased from Amazon to be available to put on my phone.  It's nice to have a little mood music in your stateroom.But even though I paid for the mp3s I want to download, I'm being told that I can't because my LG Android phone is apparently not compatible with the Android version of the app.In the words of our current Pres, ""Very, very disappointing!"""
0,Lack of cross-compatibility between music services has led me to the place where I rarely purchased music anymore. I miss the days of CDs when this was not an issue.
0,"Why would you make an app that's not compatible with your own devices? I'd say that's a big, fat fail, Amazon!"
0,"If only I had the option to rate with a zero, or even a negative value I have three tablets and two phones linked to my Amazon account, and this app is incompatible with all of them (one is even a kindle!) Seriously!? Great 'benefit' of my prime subscription that I can't even use the thing. Sure, I could use the PC app and listen at my computer, but I rarely listen at my computer. Most of music listening is done while working outside or driving. I'm usually against the all caps screaming in reviews but AMAZON FIX YOUR APP, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!Though, from the sounds of all the other reviews, I'm better off not having it on my devices to begin with. Guess I dodged a bullet? Seriously reconsidering my prime subscription now."
0,"I was sad to see that my new tablet was NOT compatible with Amazon MP3. I have Amazon Mobile and Amazon Appstore on it so I thought MP3 would be no problem andwellit's not even in the appstore for me to get and when I tried from the site,it said it wasn't compatible. I have so many credits built up,to just sit there and go to waste because my Mach Speed Trio is not compatible. Rather than it not being compatible with my tablet,I do love this! I had this on my old phone and it was awesome how easy it was to find albums,random music,and specific songs.It was super easy to get to the music and download it(purchase it with credit) and not to mention the bonus credit you get when you purchase other apps through the amazon store or buy stuff off of Amazon. 4 stars all the way,would have given it 5 if it was compatible with my tablet. Keep Rockin Amazon!"
0,"Could someone please tell me why Amazon, in its infinite wisdom, does not make this app compatible with Kindle Fire HD 8.9? It works really good on my old iphone 4s and laptop."
0,Why not?Amazon should invest in apps that are backwards compatible.No Amazon customer should have to buy a new phone to use the Amazon Music app.
0,"continual conflict in instructions from different sources within amazon and amazon music.after fussing with it on several devices (not with my ipod touch though, the app is not compatible), I still can't figure out how to stream music or create playlists.I would pay $20/month to keep using Pandora rather than use amazon prime for free."
0,"I have a kindle fire HD and suddenly the app doesn't load, says not compatible with device. Each time I tap the app a circle just spins. I tried downloading from store and it says not compatible with my device ???????"
0,Absolutely ridiculous that it is incompatible with Kindlefire. Why create an application that can't be used on your own device?
0,"I tried to download again because I read a review that it would work on my device, but when I go to purchase it still says not compatible with my device. What gives? I would think being a prime member and owning an Amazon product, they would make it available on the Kindle Fire."
0,Why is it that with the brand new kindle fire this app is not compatible? That is bizarre to me since it is an Amazon product! That needs to be changed!
0,"Somewhat difficult to maneuver and the music downloads are not compatible with other music programs or my ringtones on any of the phones I have had thus far [LG, HTC, Samsung] which is frustrating when you want to individualize a tone."
0,"Attempted  using Amazon Music and pop-up said ""Amazon Music with Prime Music is incompatible with your device. You cannot purchase this app from this device."", a Kindle Fire."
0,Too hard to use. Interface not intuitive. Not compatible with Android 5 Lollipop. Don't waste your time. I wish I could give it zero stars.
0,Tried to get this for my Fire HD7.  Says it is incompatible.  ????
0,"Why would it not be compatible with my kindle hd ! I pay for prime so it should be compatible, FAIL!"
0,"I decided to download this app because Amazon was promoting $2 off select $5 albums if I download it with this app with my android device or Kindle Fire. Well, I tried downloading the app on my Kindle Fire and it says it's NOT compatible on my device. Wouldn't that be false advertising?"
1,Music will not sync on Amazon Fire TV.  It would be ideal if music library mirrored iTunes.  Very cumbersome to use and the App is finicky at best.
0,I have the Kindle HD Fire and this app doesn't work! I have the prime account and the prime music doesn't download to my library. Won't be renewing my prime account!
0,I have an HTC Hero that's not even 2 yrs old.  I spent a lot of time picking out what music I wanted it still has 12 hrs to go.  Then I find out that my Android version isn't high enough.  It's 1.5 and  the App needs 1.6.  VERY disappointed !!!
0,How is this not compatible with the Kindle Fire?!  Doesn't make any sense to me what so ever.  How can I listen to the music then?!
0,"This was preinstalled on my G2 and I can't uninstall. To add insult to injury, after I force close it, it likes to start up on its own whenever the phone changes state. So it eats memory and battery not cool."
0,The player part of this app crashes my ATRIX every time. Hopefully this will be fixed in the near future.
0,I'm not familiar with the Android OSor the versions available.  This app says it needs 1.6 or higherI have 2.2 but it won't work. any suggestions?
